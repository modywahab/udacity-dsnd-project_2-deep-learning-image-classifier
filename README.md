# Deep learning Image Classifier
This project is the 5th project submitted for Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree program.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will have hands-on experience with building Deep learning models with Pytorch. You will use the Flowers families images dataset to create a flower classifier using these images.

### Part 1
You will use a Jupyter notebook to build,  train, and test your deep learning classifier. Then you will write an inference method that will take a png image of a flower as input and the top probable classes of this flower as output.

### Part 2
You will write two command line applications, that perform the following:
	-  train.py :  train a deep learning classifier, given a dataset and multiple hyperparameters
	-  predict.py: inputs a deep learning model object and image, and output the top probable classes.
